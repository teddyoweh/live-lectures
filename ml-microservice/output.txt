 Just to go away my name is Aaron Diller from the school of the science. I'm an excellent engineering team. My new cybersecurity and threat intel. So for intel piece of my job is pretty much tracking cyber actors who target the financial sector and provide intel to our to our team. And the cybersecurity aspect of my job is taking that intel and using it to implement the and the cyber security aspect of my job is taking that intel and using it to implement the entourage tools to either set up blocks in the lanes or blocks that place some malicious malware and also build little machines or build the new machines for people who to compromise sites. So today we're going to do a crisis simulation for the new machine for people who can compromise sites. So today we're going to do a crisis simulation for the new one ability. This is a veris of lab. This is a platform that be used to pretty much training our analysts on our team. So I see, um, versatile labs is good for building playbooks and different scenarios for a certain or more relevant in recent, uh, vulnerabilities have happened in the wild. So any big So they're going to see big attack you've seen, ransomware-wise, or like the attack this happened on the variety of things they attacked recently. But all those attacks are sitting in the immersive labs that we've used are hidden immersive labs that we use are on playbooks in crisis simulations to train on and in 40 itself. So they haven't got over the building. which happened this year. And we're going to walk through the steps of crisis response during an active incident. You all hear me? So what is going to do you, I do you know, what's the right one? So what is all the wrong, so what is going along in your laptop or your phones and we'll go through this? So just a quick background. In the 2023, progress software has a zero day vulnerability in a movement file transfer software. The clock ransomware, a billion lace, Laced Tempus, which meant all the companies provided services to were also at risk. Zealous, a third-party payroll provider, one of those firms, which meant all the companies provided services to were also at risk. The attack they involved ransomware, And so within it didn't all rents what they load but instead the criminals extract the staff member names addresses national insurance numbers so security numbers and even make account details this scenario is based on that event uh this will go there so scenario is you work for a British retail giant named beaches. Beach is a nationwide pharmacy chain and beach sets under the retail locations. and in place thousands of stats. It all sources multiple administrative tasks to manage costs including payroll services to improve third party suppliers. So, you're going to play wrong with? that site and the internet code there. So, Prague its software, corporations have notified you of a possible vulnerability to secure file transfer of software called MoveIt. This zero-degree vulnerability could result in authorized access to user systems. But it's unclear how much this would impact the organization systems and data. A fix has been released for the vulnerability. What's your first course of asking, the first course of asking, course of action actually based on the information available. So these are your choices. Now option one, identify whether you use the software internally or option two, wait for further information to emerge. So based on information you know now about the incident happened, let the information pick what the best answer you think is next course of action. I'm going to see what I'm going to. All right? All right. You don't pick option one. Identify whether you use software internally. Incorrect, that is the great answer, as of the correct answer. So you're going to identify where the use of software internally. Any vulnerability of this size should be taken seriously, especially if it's a zero day, which move it was in zero vulnerability. They want to zero-day vulnerability. Anybody know what zero means? So zero day means that the vulnerability has just been discovered and there's no patch for it. So it's meaning zero days and forth has been discovered. So meaning there's no patch in place for the vulnerability. It's pretty much new vulnerability that's been discovered. So we identified whether they used software internally, based on information that we know. All right, you confirmed that beaches does not use the movement All right, if you confirm that beaches does not use the movement software internally and is not installed in any of the systems, however, it may be used by third parties who need to access your data. Now, which steps should you take based on the information that you have now? So you have four options. Option one, you should sit in urge communication asking the whole organization to contact you if they use move it to share data to share data with a third party. Or two, get an update list of all the third-party suppliers that act as data processors for you. Option three, wait to hear from your suppliers if they have been impacted. Or option four, request no one in your organization uses move it, and tell you have more about the issue. You can vote now. This is an important step. All the majority chose option two, it says now the focus should be on the data processor work. The majority chose option two, getting an update list of all the third party suppliers that act as a data processor work. exposed your data. And accessing an up-to-date data list of data is the best option here. You'll have a complete picture of where it might have been used in your supply chain. And this is good because although you may not have been directly impacted, a company that you do business with or work with maybe impacted, which means the company that you, that a vendor of yours may have been impacted in that vendor hold information of your employees. So it's important to know, okay, maybe we're not impacted, but company A, who goes data for maybe a third of our company has impacted. So indirectly, our employees have impacted basis on that company is supposed that they've been impacted. So that's why it's important to reach out to reach out to the companies to the companies. do own that software or you can direct business with, even if you're not directly impacted. All right, a finance team member has gotten contact with you. They've seen a post referencing the current group vulnerability on social media, they're concerned as they regularly use the software to share employees data with the third-party organization, Intinet Plus, which provides peer-year services. which provides peer-year-old services. The crisis benefit team is engaged now. So now, which steps do you think is the next step to take? Today, option one, contact, antenna plus immediately, and act whether they have been impacted. Option two, identify exactly what information may your colleagues shared over the movement software with and win. Option three, begin calling all your third-party data process alphabetically, or option four, wait to hear, from Intenplus. You can vote now. You can vote now. limited but based on making you have you think the next step should be. your colleagues share over the moving software and when? So it says it's a good answer. So the best answer here is to immediately contact Edna Plus to check your bear impact. You need to understand the risk profile ASAP. People didn't need to consider the best way to contact Edna Plus and whether Beaches has a format for asking this question. Now this the when it says the direct way of contact the internet plus because most sometimes when companies are impacted or have been compromised that means that maybe their email system is compromised too. So email is not the best way to contact that company because the threat actor is probably marketing the emails. So some companies do have protocols in place to if they've been contact, if they've been compromised, if you believe they're compromised, do you contact them over all to your channels? So do you just follow that playbook to what their playbook protocol has for you to contact them? What channels it either is female or if you need to do a direct phone call? We don't have any so we don't have any that we have to you know. We don't serve any other I have been I've been on a I've been compromised or maybe by Martin, I've yet friends that Martin prepared the dark web. by monitoring that we have friends that Martin heard the Dark Web and they let us know okay we've seen information on the Dark Web we've seen a hacker for you know planning have access to your data then we'll reach out to that company saying hey we get a reason to leave you've been compromised. compromise. The list of questions that we have to go like, get reasons to be your compromise. What's actually the goal of the goal of the rule means data? Let us know please, can you confirm to the compliance of the nine, let's know what you're doing through meeting the, their compromise and also how to dedicate to your systems. you decide to contact into the plus directly to ask what was the impact and the plus confirmed they did suffer a data breach due to the mortality. The extent of the compromise is still unclear but you could include personal data such as your employee's name addresses National Insurance Number you bank account details. What is your next steps? want to make a public statement, option three, gather further information, or option four, update staff members on the possible reach of their personal data. Pick which thing the best answer is? It's not a bad answer. The majority. All right, as a majority. You said update your regulators. The majority said update your regulators. Great answer. All right. So with this type of data at risk is important that you do this and as well as possible brief to the regulators. You have same two hours to complete the report. So it's always a good thing to update the regulators because you have, like, like I said, you have a tunnel online here for certain events, when to update their letters, and even through like certain organizations like government organizations as well, they do have timelines to when they post report on any type of particular incident. And also there's been new guidance that just went out. It's still, I don't think it's been approved fully yet, but his new guidelines regarding our ransomware ransomware updates and when their timelines were reported and also if they paid the ransom. And also if they paid the ransom amount. All right. staff about the breach and they are curious your HR team is is fielding a clarity of inquiries from now what did you do now? The HR team is magnitude in the form of a different grant members for us. So option one, promise credit monitoring services option two send out information to not information impact to all staff members or option three, state that you're waiting to see how the situation lays out. You can vote on the best answer now. All right, let's see what's the answer. All right, let's see how you did. All right, the big option two, sitting on information back to all staff members. activity and this is so they can pretty much put creative and the modern services in place to have arm to their credit, let them know that a human impacted. I know some of you probably all have you seen letters before. There's plenty of time with my information impacted. You can get a letter to mail. And they do offer certain things like credit market services or tell you to market credit or for the next year stuff. All right. The magnitude of this heck has led substantial press interest. Beaches has been named the victim due to its ties with Aetna Plus, along with several other large British companies. How do you respond? Now this is your media relations now. So how do you respond as media? In Jek 1, I mean option 1, don't respond to the media. Now, this is your media, you respond, you respond, you're, you're going, respond. with a whole thing statement or action three respond with a full statement. Put you up now. Okay, majority picked option two, respond with the whole thing. Let's see. That's a good answer. It's a good answer, but not the great answer. with the whole whole thing. Let's see. That's a good answer. It's a good answer, but not the great answer. So it has been relations in the moving crisis has been extremely high. The best strategy here is to respond with the full statement, particularly if you've taken positive actions to aid staff. So the full statement just include the breach, how you were infected, but how some of your other companies that you worked for impact it, and you were impacted, but how some your other companies you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were you were. and we have have the decision protocols within the reach outs and everything and we have remediation processes in places. So the Clop Rensselware Group has released a statement is given all companies impacted by your attack that on June 14th to contact them using the link provided. severe consequences. there will be severe consequences. So you have five options here. Option one, engage a professional negotiator, option two, ignore the request. Option three, contact clock yourself. Option four, contact Aetna Plus, and pressure their reps for response on ultimatum. plus and gase the authorities. go now. and they're going to go now. And this is typical of ransomware threat actors. They'll grab your data. And they used to lock it, right? And this is typical of ransomware thread actors. They'll grab your data. And they used to lock it, right, use to add extensions to all your data, like, you'd, you'd like an extension, you can't like an extension. extensions to all your data like either like an extension you can't open or the extension of their like their ransomware name at the end of all your files in your computer and then they'll add a text file which is the ransom note on your computer so when you open it up all you get the random note and you can't open all the your files because the extension of course can be open up in your program on your computer. But now they've done they've done they just grab it and then ransom it off to you by saying everybody they are in X amount of days. The responses. All right, the gay or the authorities, that's the great answer. What you want to do is the gauze the authorities. Never contact them on your own or directly to the grand somewhere group or threat actor. Some brancomer groups of acting compromise.. of acting compromise machines and they'll go in and they'll read your cybersecurity insurance policy and I'll see okay you're covered the $5 million so they'll ransom your stuff back $5 million and you can't say oh we don't have had $5 million and they say they go to those $5 million dollars and they go they go to those extents. And you can't say oh we don't have $5 million. is hey we see your assurance costs you have money like this. They go to those extents. All right, so you just complete the movie Zero Day, Immersive Labs, price simulation. This is a situation. This situation takes place whenever there's been a vendor breach, these breach-outs happen to all our vendors have been, have been a, uh, vendor's at the vendor's at the end of reach. These reachouts happen to all our vendors have been impact on the vendors have everything impact on our vendors have everything impact on the impact on the impact on the impact on our benefit, have everything impact on our benefit. is it like the step that we take to talk to those vendors? Any questions from anyone? As far as like the process or what it entails the additional? I have a question. out for us. us. So for the media statement, you said that we're going to be a statement, you said the charges would be as specific as possible about it, but then that was, you know, you want to be more. No, no, because you want to be as specific and detailed. the stuff you can't you can't you can't say like you know the ransomware group name or these certain things you can't put out there of what was taken right but you can let you know the hey it did happen yes he just steps to be taken to recover from that incident you know we have stuck in motion later later on as you know stuff progresses on so you can be as thorough as you can be as thorough as you can with not I had a question also a new statement too but for full disclosure on the documents I said somewhat like the holding statement more so. What was I said because what if you don't know the full scope of how much like damage it was done to do the site you come too early saying it not really know in the full scope because I remember one of my classes we went through it was like an ethics class but someone reported way too soon and it was something to do with a I think it was a crisis but like millions of Americans accounts got really but it didn't disclose it's like months later so how would you like go about if you don't people yeah this will be in your update right so you'll say like this is what we know and then you can say this what we don't know right and you can say you know later updates that comes later on so you can say okay this what we know about the incident you know it happened on this day x y x y and z this is what they took you know we're doing these message methods to account to to mediate to account to to mediate that they can't get in again or if been eradicated we comes to the authorities they're currently investigating it so when so when so when the authorities so when the authorities so when the the threat vendors be involved and really is not too much you can say as legal reasons but you can say you have contacted the authorities and they're investigating it. So you're not saying so you're not saying too much for the you're not giving that area where you say too little and then you know because I feel like with customers you want to always have to trust in mind so if you don't like have the whole detail I feel like people would be impatient with that so I feel like it's kind of a get to find an in-between basically be giving enough information for them to actually understand it's like dire but these are the steps you can take to make to like help yeah yeah exactly exactly Any questions? All right, good. All good. So that includes that workshop. Yeah. So, I'm just curious about like your overall background is the case area? Is this like always there you in? Like, when I'm going to be a background? So, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, you're in a...
